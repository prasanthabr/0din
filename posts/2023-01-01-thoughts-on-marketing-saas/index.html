<a href=/tags/podcast>podcast</a><div><p><em>the [podcast][2] was a catchup on the top 10 themes that were discussed the year</em>
<em>I heard this yesterday and am typing in the details that I remember</em></p><p><strong>On Leveraged, , Overhead (LWO) tasks</strong><br>Not all tasks are created equal, certain tasks will have a leveraged impact
Leveraged impact means the outcome is a multiple (eg: 10x) of the effort taken
The same task can fall into different outcome multiples based on context
Success would be to identify the nature of the task and tackle appropriately</p><p><strong>On insights and analytics</strong><br>Measurement is not insight - knowing power users use discount codes is measurement
Understanding why the power user does this is the insight
Once the insight is understood, behaviour can be changed by reducing friction at touch points</p><p><strong>On smaller teams</strong><br>Knowledge industry, the workers have the highest cost.
Every new worker, increases the touch point with rest of the team geometrically
Small empowered nimble teams will [run circles][1] around larger teams</p><p><strong>SEO impact</strong>
SEO is as effective as advertising or at least is as important
SEO works for business to consumer best
What is the source from where a consumer makes a buying decision - for enterprise its less likely Google
Certain cases, SEO may include targeting the user who fits a certain profile, rather than search terms</p><p><strong>On Segmentation</strong>
&lt;I do not remember this one, but there were some smart examples of targeting consumers></p><p><strong>On Product Pricing</strong></p><p><strong>On freemium products</strong>
Publish features that are commoditized
Publish features that improve stand out nature of product
Publish features that are commonly needed
Do not publish features that increase operational friction</p><ul><li>source: Lenny&rsquo;s Podcast : top 10 episodes of 2022<br>[1]: <a href=https://thoughtbot.com>https://thoughtbot.com</a><br>[2]: <a href=https://www.lennyspodcast.com/countdown-of-the-top-10-episodes-of-the-year/>https://www.lennyspodcast.com/countdown-of-the-top-10-episodes-of-the-year/</a></li></ul></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/0din/posts/2023-01-01-thoughts-on-marketing-saas/>Thoughts on Marketing Saas</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2023 <a href=https://prasanthabr.github.io/0din><b>0din</b></a>.
